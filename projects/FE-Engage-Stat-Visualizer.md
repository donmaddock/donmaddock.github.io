A quick project I made to help me while playing through the video game Fire Emblem: Engage. The app lets you pick a combination of unit and class to get a view of what growth rates that unit would have.

This project used React as well as a graph API. The data was taken from the site serene forest, which I then cleaned up to work for my needs.
