Created for my final project for a computer graphics class, this grass is made using HLSL shader code. The code is excuted on the GPU and draws blades of grass over a canvas that I 3D modeled in Blender.

The animation of the grass uses a my own custom perlin noise function which allows the grass to blow in a random yet smooth manner.
