summary: Recreating a classic song in FL Studio

In an effort to learn the ins and outs of FL Studio, a digital audio workstation for making music, I decided to try and transcribe the shop theme from one of my favorite childhood games "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time".

It was a fun experience in which I learned many different things:

<ul>
  <li>The piano roll of the program and creating musical patterns</li>
  <li>Listening out for many different instruments and trying to find the notes by ear</li>
  <li>"Soundfonts", the specific MIDI instruments to really get that old school sound</li>
  <li>VSTs, additional plugins to actually use the soundfont</li>
  <li>Audio mixing, a beast I for sure need more practice with</li>
</ul>

After listening to that cowbell for hours, I also decided to try and mix in *another* song I heard a lot as a kid as it sounded pretty similar.
