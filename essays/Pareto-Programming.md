I believe out of all the things you learn from school classes, it's always the broader, more meta skills that are the most valuable. Maybe I'll *never* use that Quadratic Formula I learned in Sophomore math class, but the problem solving skills gained from using it will stick with me forever. For the case of my recently finished Software Engineering class, I think the biggest thing I took away was a strong reinforcement of the Pareto Principle, a thought paradigm that seems to apply to almost any skill in life.

## The 80/20 Rule

Simply put, the Pareto Principle suggests that 80 percent of your results and output comes from just 20 percent of your actions, or input. Perhaps what makes the idea so applicable is its vagueness. And yet, time and time again it seems to ring true. Learning a new program or IDE? Most of your work will be the result of just a handful of tools the program has to offer. Starting a new project? It always seems like the core functionality is done super quick, and the touch ups take four times longer.

The rule may give the idea that you should always focus on that mega efficient 20, but I believe it also helps you rationalize and accept the "inefficient" 80. Want to be a world class athlete? Maybe you *could* be 80 percent as good with just 20 percent of their hours trained, but to *truly* catch up, you need to put in the full amount.

### Reacting to that data

Why digress about some self help buzzword concept for so long? Because I do believe that it, along with my experiences from class, will help my coding future. While working on my final project, a good majority of the results was from taking the handful of practice assignments we had prior, and then stretching the use cases and repurposing the ideas into a fully functional app. In fact, I'd say almost all super cool apps made by my peers in class were started in this same vein. 

For any open source or external library I use in the future, my goal will now be to focus learning those rockstar concepts or APIs that will give me the most bang for my buck. And if I'm up forever wondering why I've spent hours learning some other function I only needed to accomplish one niche thing, I'll know that that's just how things are.

To be more concrete, the concepts that personally provided the most results to me were the basic database APIs (adding, deleting, checking, and updating data) and some basic knowledge in React (a popular Javascript library for making user interfaces). Doing work on data will **always** be important in apps, and React will help make your app more usable to more people. Properly learning "hooks" or other React concepts is certainly on my To-Do list, but I know from experience I can get something good looking even from the basics.
