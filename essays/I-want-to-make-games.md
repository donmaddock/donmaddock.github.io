*I really should get used to saying that.*

I've always wanted to make games as a kid. And yet, most of my life, it's never something I ever talk or act on much. Maybe it's partially because I usually downplay how much I like video games in general. Even to this day I'll always introduce my hobbies as "games, swimming, and tennis". Sure, I love the more sporty hobbies too, but I've never dreamed of becoming a swimmer or tennis player when I grew up. Maybe it's because I've never had a "worthy" creation to back up my words. Whatever the case, everyone has to start somewhere.

The dream job as a kid was always "game programmer" because, at the time, that's all I really understood about the development process. Learning about it more, I realize the field is *so* broad and there really are hundreds of different skill sets that could take you there. Those hundreds of people you see in a game's end credits were all responsible for something unique, after all. After learning that, the question became "which skills do I learn?"

## Jack of trades, master of... One?

So I tried it all. Programming, art, animation, 3D modeling, playing music, making music, maybe learning Japanese to work where my favorite games were made. The list goes on. The big thing I learned is that these skills go ***deep***. The more you learn, the more you appreciate and understand the amount of time and effort it takes to get good at *one* of these skills. Trying to go pro in them all would be insane.

If I had to choose, I'd say I'd like to focus on the programming side of games (a field with a million branches in itself). There's always been something euphoric about finally squashing a bug or working past a coding roadblock, like beating a tough level in a game. Building a complex program too big to grasp one line at a time is always fulfilling.

But at the end of the day, I'll always want to learn about these other fields too. Theyâ€™re all interesting in their own ways. While I study to learn more about programming, a day I learn even a little about any of these skills is a success in my book.
