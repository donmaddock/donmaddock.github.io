## It's the Wild West out there, where you can return what you want and push what you like.

 It's interesting how what you know can sometimes impede you from what you want to learn. This was the case for me learning Javascript. The language offers a ton of new features and flexibility, but it can be hard to use any of it because I was still "thinking" in the languages I know. You learn a concept or idea that's just similar enough to think you have it down fine but *just* different enough to throw you for a loop (for...in loops were a culprit of this). My inner monologue the first few days was along the lines of:
 
 > "Okay, instead of declaring types you just use var. That's neat. Oh. But it seems like everyone wants you to use let or const instead. I'll learn about let, and const works just like I'm used to right?" 

 > "Yes but you're still allowed to change properties of objects. And by when we say "objects" it's more like a key value pairs that work a little differently than-

Stop. Can't we just call it something else?

## False Friends

Now, none of this is Javascript's fault. After all, the same issue might happen to a person who started with Javascript trying to learn a strongly typed language. It's not a programming exclusive problem either. In spoken languages, this is sometimes referred to as a "false friend".

For example, the Spanish word for Library would be "biblioteca". However, the Spanish word for a book shop, somewhere you'd actually *buy* books, is librería. You might see the word librería at a glance and think you know exactly what it means because you know the word "library", but you'd be incorrect because of it.

It's a minor nuisance but nothing more. I'm sure in the end it'd be even more annoying if every programming language had some different name to describe what is more or less the same idea. With enough practice, you won't even remember it as an issue.

## Putting it to Use
By far my favorite kind of practice for ICS classes has been athletic programming. Fun challenges to test what you know and try to quickly Google what you don't. The time pressure I find helps keep me focused and on track.

I've always liked the *idea* of programming challenges, but never actually go out and do them. With JSFiddle it's super quick and easy to take a crack at them. Looking at my professor's or other people's solutions after I'd tried myself is also very informative. While my solution might be written in Javascript, seeing a solution that actually uses the language to the fullest really helps you learn its ins and outs. I'm *still* blown away by that isUnique WOD solution.
