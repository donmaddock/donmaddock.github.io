> "I thought using loops was cheating, so I programmed my own using samples. I then thought using samples was cheating, so I recorded real drums. I then thought that programming it was cheating, so I learned to play drums for real. I then thought using bought drums was cheating, so I learned to make my own. I then thought using premade skins was cheating, so I killed a goat and skinned it. I then thought that that was cheating too, so I grew my own goat from a baby goat. I also think that is cheating, but I'm not sure where to go from here. I haven't made any music lately, what with the goat farming and all."

In many professions, but particularly in the line of programming, I see many people get lost in wanting to recreate the wheel. Rather than use what exists, they want to make their own APIs, frameworks, you name it. They spend so much time making their own custom game engine but never actually make a game. Maybe it's for a greater sense of control of their tool, or perhaps they feel using someone else's work is cheating.

 However, I'd argue that learning to use and leverage code made by other people is an extremely important skill on its own, and one that everyone needs to balance along with the DIY mentality, rather than choosing one or the other. Over the past few weeks I really felt this sentiment while learning front end web design.

## UI for you and I

Let me backpedal a bit and say that I don't think those people trying to make their own tools are wasting their time. Taking the time to really learn the fundamentals will give you an edge when the hot new technology framework switches to something else. Maybe those people will be the ones to make it. But for some, we just want to have a good looking webpage. We don't have the time or drive to become sages in both programming AND artistic design. Or even if some people are well versed in both, I can't imagine they want to spend all their time manually centering divs.

That's where frameworks come in. Spend less time worrying about the details and more time making the app you actually want to make, because some people were gracious enough to already do that work *for* you. Now, does that mean there's no point in learning HTML or CSS? Do I really need to know how to write some simple functions when there's already a library for me? Absolutely.

## Even Growth

Using frameworks is a skill in itself, and the stronger your foundation, the more you'll be working alongside your framework rather than against it. For example, while using Semantic UI it became really clear where my gaps in CSS were. I had become so reliant on the framework I found myself hunting through its documentation just to find how to put down text. I had no idea some Semantic interacted with my stylesheet so I ended up just lazily slapping "important!" everywhere. Semantic is a powerful tool for sure, but when the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem starts to look like a nail. Some issues I could have solved with much less of a headache simply knowing more basics is CSS like text alignment or the flexbox.

So with these problems in mind you really should spend all that time on fundamentals right? Yes and no. You don't want to miss the forest for the trees. And like a tree, it's true you need a strong foundation to grow. However, I can't think of any tree that completely grows its trunk and *then* starts branching out. Especially when you're first learning, I believe you need to start out with both, growing evenly along the way.
