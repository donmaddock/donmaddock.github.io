## Test
There are times where ESLint can feel like my mom nagging me to do dishes. As soon as I declare a variable, I'm already being pestered that it's not being used. But from each error thrown at me, it does teach me a bit more Javascript. For example, let and const have been a new concept I have yet to really put any thought into. However, when I get an error from Lint saying that there's no reason to use let if I never reassign a varaible, I start to really consider the different use cases.

In an effort to avoid more errors thrown at me, I'm preemtively typing in better code. The benefits of this seem worth the headache. Code that's easier to read is easier to debug, and when your code looks the same as other people using the standards, it's a lot easier to wrap your head around.

## Confession Time
I have yet do any major code refaction for code I've written (maybe not the best line to put in a resume essay). The scope of my class and personal projects have simply never been large enough to warrant it. That being said, I can understand the merits of it. Like cleaning a messy room, work is done so much easier when code is more clean.

This is extra important when is something you haven't touched in months, of never touched at all, in the case of somebody elses code. Coding standards can save a lot of time when your initial code extra clean. Of course, you'd still be changing things like variable names of how code interacts with eachother, but at least then you're focusing on that than the less important
